# Introduction

json-maps is a declarative JSON spec for interactive maps. Write JSON, get a map.

Built on [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org/) (free, no API key required) with [CARTO](https://carto.com/) basemaps and React for widgets and overlays.

## Why json-maps?

Most map libraries require imperative code — initialize a map, add markers, configure layers, handle events. json-maps inverts this: you describe **what** you want as a JSON object, and the renderer handles the **how**.

This makes maps:

- **AI-friendly** — LLMs can generate and stream map specs as JSON
- **Serializable** — save, share, and version control your maps
- **Declarative** — no imperative map API to learn
- **Reactive** — change the spec, the map updates

## Quick Example

```json
{
  "basemap": "dark",
  "center": [77.59, 12.97],
  "zoom": 12,
  "pitch": 45
}
```

This gives you a dark-themed map centered on Bangalore with a tilted perspective. Every field is optional — an empty `{}` gives you a light basemap at world view.

## What's in the Spec

The spec grows incrementally. Here's what's supported today:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Basemap | Available |
| Viewport (center, zoom, pitch, bearing) | Available |
| Markers | Coming soon |
| Layers (GeoJSON, MVT, raster, PMTiles) | Coming soon |
| Controls (zoom, compass, scale) | Coming soon |
| Widgets (legend, layer toggle) | Coming soon |
| Color system (continuous, categorical) | Coming soon |

## Inspiration

json-maps draws from three projects:

- **[json-render](https://github.com/AlfredPros/json-render)** — the spec-to-renderer pattern and JSONL streaming
- **[mapcn](https://github.com/milind-soni/mapcn)** — MapLibre component architecture and widget positioning
- **[fusedmaps](https://github.com/milind-soni/fusedmaps)** — data-driven layers, color system, and widget design
