# Introduction

json-maps is a declarative JSON spec for interactive maps. Write JSON, get a map.

Built on [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org/) (free, no API key required) with [CARTO](https://carto.com/) basemaps and React for widgets and overlays.

## Why json-maps?

Most map libraries require imperative code — initialize a map, add markers, configure layers, handle events. json-maps inverts this: you describe **what** you want as a JSON object, and the renderer handles the **how**.

This makes maps:

- **AI-friendly** — LLMs can generate and stream map specs as JSON
- **Serializable** — save, share, and version control your maps
- **Declarative** — no imperative map API to learn
- **Reactive** — change the spec, the map updates

## Quick Example

```json
{
  "basemap": "dark",
  "center": [77.59, 12.97],
  "zoom": 12,
  "pitch": 45
}
```

This gives you a dark-themed map centered on Bangalore with a tilted perspective. Every field is optional — an empty `{}` gives you a light basemap at world view.

## What's in the Spec

The spec grows incrementally. Here's what's available and what's coming:

**Available now:**

- [Basemap](/docs/basemap) — `light`, `dark`, `streets`, or custom style URL
- [Viewport](/docs/viewport) — `center`, `zoom`, `pitch`, `bearing`, `bounds`

**Coming soon:**

- [Markers](/docs/markers) — named pins with labels and popups
- [Layers](/docs/layers) — GeoJSON, MVT, raster, PMTiles
- [Controls](/docs/controls) — zoom, compass, scale bar
- [Widgets](/docs/widgets) — legend, layer toggle, basemap switcher
- [Color System](/docs/colors) — continuous and categorical data-driven color
